In Wild Card, we offer players the chance to step into the shoes of the enigmatic "Joker," navigating a dystopian city plagued by greed and strange creatures.

This layered story provides players with a compelling reason to progress, making each moment in the game more meaningful and immersive.

Inspired by the four suits of a deck of cards, Wild Card offers distinct transformations for the Joker, each with its own unique abilities and gameplay mechanics:
- Hearts: Focus on healing, health, and survival, with a mix of buffs and debuffs.
